# ProjEuler

// This repository was created to begin a path of solving as many Project Euler problems in Java. 
// The link to project Euler is below in case you wanted to check out the problems for yourself!


// https://projecteuler.net/archives 

// THe purpose of creating a repository with my solutions to Project Euler problems is to hopefully
// help others who chose to embark on this seemingly difficult (but FUN!) task, but also
// if (i mean WHEN) i do get stuck, hopefully, there are those who are nice enough to help!
// Thank you very much in advance if you do decide to help in any way imaginable! 

// Have a wonderful amazing day! :)
